# MadLibs
kateeliza29.github.io/madLibs

## Introduction
Made in November 2019, this is a simple MadLibs game. 
Simply fill in the form of the left hand side, press the button and your story is generated.

I made this project early in my web development journey, and the focus was on improving my skills of DOM manipulation. 

## Technologies Used 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Scope and Improvements
At the moment, the user can type words into the form, which are then used to populate the story, before displaying it.
If I were to move this project forward, I would do the following:
* Incorporate the ability to choose different stories, either by hiding/showing panels, or pulling in stories/word requirements from an external data source. 
* Refactor the code to use a loop, rather than repeating code to retrieve data and fill in the gaps in the story.
